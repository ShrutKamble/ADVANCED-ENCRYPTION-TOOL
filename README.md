How it works:

Project Title: ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL 
The Encryption Project implements a file encryption and decryption tool using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with a 256-bit key. It uses the PyCryptodome library for cryptographic functions and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

Key Features:
Key Generation: A secure 256-bit key is generated using get_random_bytes() and saved as a .key file.
File Encryption: The selected file is encrypted using AES in ECB mode. It is padded to ensure itâ€™s a multiple of 16 bytes, then encrypted and saved with a .enc extension.
File Decryption: The encrypted .enc file is decrypted using the same key, unpadded, and saved as the original file.
Process:
Generate Key: The user generates and saves a 256-bit key.
Encrypt File: The user selects a file and encrypts it using the saved key.
Decrypt File: The user decrypts the encrypted file back to its original form using the same key.
Tools Used:
PyCryptodome: Handles AES encryption/decryption and padding.
Tkinter: Provides a GUI for key generation, encryption, and decryption tasks.
This tool helps secure sensitive files by converting them into unreadable formats, which can only be decrypted with the correct key.
